# WasteClassification

waste classification and recycling using deep learning models such as CNN and MobileNet. The project involved training the models on a dataset of waste images and classifying them into different categories such as paper, metal, glass, and more. Furthermore, I developed a recommendation system that suggests relevant YouTube videos for recycling the classified waste items. Through this project, I gained expertise in deep learning, computer vision, and recommendation systems, and also contributed to promoting sustainable practices through technology.
